## About
This Project Marvel Movies Restful Api is a developed as a part of our CLOUD COMPUTING MODULE whose goal is to apply and extend the techniques of different aspects of Cloud applications. We have created a database on Marvel Movies and Marvel Characters and using the Postman, we  interact with any available HTTP endpoint, including REST-enabled database endpoints. Instead of querying a database directly, we are using Postman to read and write to a database via a REST API.
